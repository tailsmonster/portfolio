<!--  
raah!!

Virtual buisness card of sorts. Contains important links and a portfolio section that includes a gallary and URLs.

This'll basically be my version of the lab for school, but I wanna make this the coolest website I can, as I want to publish this on the web to have my own website!


**What I'll need**
* A Hero portion on index.html, just being a cool bg, my logo, my name (Nico, not Nicholas), and a quirky message

* A short About Me description showing what I do, grabbing my discord profile picture, and my interests and hobbies. *A short but sweet overview on what I do hehe.*

* A Bunch of buttons that lead to a gallery website, and some other links to some other projects (Like one for Sonic 4 ReRun)

* Cool, minimalist abstraction design. I had a book I wish I still had to use as a moodboard, but basically I want my signature beige and dark purple, with colors that pop

* retro aestethic, while still very poppy. In other words, cool but not RETRO PETRO. Maybe a better example would be Persona (3) or the classic sonic title cards.
